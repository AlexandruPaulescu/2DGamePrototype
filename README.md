# 2DGamePrototype
This is one of my unfinished games using Unity3D, that is also polished enough to put it here.

Started working on this project in June 2020 and stopped working on it around February 2021.
It is a 2D Dungeon Rogue-Like ( like Soul Knight on Mobile or Enter the Gungeon on PC ).
It was designed only for Android and IOS, with future compatibility to PC and Consoles.

If anyone wants to further develop the project or just use it, go ahead. It's CC0.

Here is some early gameplay : https://youtu.be/iWNruLDWiyo
